# 1.1

1. The difference comes from definition:
	- statement: A piece of code to be run by the computer
	- comment:   A comment on the functionality or something else, it isn't a
	  functional feature.
2. portable can have many contexts:
	- No need to rewrite to port compiled code
	- Near nonexistent changes in the code to be used in other machine.
		+ Java uses the JVM to accomplish this
3. compile means acquire and aggregate something.
	- In this sense, means the transformation from source code to a running
	  program
4. executable is a running program, which you can execute in your machine. It
   is used as noun, rather than an adjective, because it refers to the type of
file on its own, rather than to classify it.
